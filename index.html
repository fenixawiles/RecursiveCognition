    <h1>Welcome to Sonder (Alpha)</h1>
    <p>Thanks for helping us test Sonder. This is a very early version, and your feedback will help shape what it becomes.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>Sonder is designed for thoughtful, reflective conversation. It’s here to help you explore your thoughts — not to solve problems or give advice. Sometimes it will ask questions. Sometimes it will offer reflections to help you think more clearly. It isn’t perfect (yet). That’s why you’re here.</p>

    <h2>How to Talk to Sonder</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Speak naturally, like you would to a person you trust.</li>
        <li>Share thoughts, feelings, frustrations, curiosities — anything on your mind.</li>
        <li>Sonder’s job is to help you reflect, not to fix things.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Your Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>Your conversations are not stored.</strong><br>
    Nothing you say to Sonder is saved after your session ends. The only thing we collect is your feedback through the feedback form.</p>

    <h2>What We Need From You</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When did Sonder feel natural or human?</li>
        <li>Where did it feel robotic or off?</li>
        <li>Did it help you think more clearly, or just fill space?</li>
        <li>What would you want Sonder to do differently?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This is a Work in Progress</h2>
    <p>By using this, you’re helping us learn what works, what doesn’t, and what needs to change to make Sonder more useful, more human, and more meaningful.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you for helping shape the future of this project.</strong></p>
